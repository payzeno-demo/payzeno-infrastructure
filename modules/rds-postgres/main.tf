# modules/rds-postgres
#
# Postgres 15 instance + parameter group + subnet group + credentials secret + two alarms.
# Used twice in each environment: module.db_api (payzeno_api) and module.db_ledger
# (payzeno_ledger). Two databases, two instances, no shared server — the ledger is the
# system of record for money and it does not share a connection budget with the API's
# session store.
#
# The parameter group did not exist before month 7. mregression added it during arc PERF
# (PAY-1744) because there was no way to find the slow settlement query without
# pg_stat_statements, and the answer to "why is the sweep taking 40 minutes" was going to be
# guessed otherwise. It is the single most useful eleven lines in this module.
